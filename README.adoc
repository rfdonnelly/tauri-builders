= Builders for Tauri Apps using Docker

Build Tauri apps for various unsupported distros using Docker.

This is mostly to solve the glibc problem where building a Tauri app on a newer distro (with a newer glibc) will not work on older distros (with an older glibc).
But the opposite works: build your Tauri app on an older distro will work on both the older distro and newer distros.

== CentOS 7

See link:centos7[centos7].

KNOWN ISSUE: The app builds successfully but does not render the page.

== CentOS 8

TBD
